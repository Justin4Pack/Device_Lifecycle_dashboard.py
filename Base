# Flowchart Explanation for Replacement Process

1. **Annual Device Review**:
    - Confirm device functionality and support status.
2. **Assess Support Status**:
    - Is the device still within the support period? Check manufacturer support timelines.
3. **Evaluate Maintenance Cost vs Replacement Cost**:
    - If the annual maintenance cost exceeds 30% of the replacement cost, consider replacing.
4. **Make Replacement Decision**:
    - If unsupported, recommend replacement.
    - If nearing end of support, plan for replacement within the next year.
